# practice and learn data structures and algorithms in C++

This is my brain exercise.

## sorting

- bubble sort: Runs in O(N^2) time in the worst case. O(N) when array is already sorted.

- selection sort: runs in O(n^2) time in the best/worst case. There are two loops inside the algorithm.

- insertion sort: runs in O(n^2) time in the worst case, but in a linear order when elements are sorted from the beginning.

## Some notes for my learning

### why do templates need to be in the header file?
because templates are instantiation-style polymorphism.
